## The 6001x folder has work from the online course that I did
Link to the course: https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:MITx+6.00.1x_11+1T2017/info

## The web folder has work that I've been doing on another online course
It's called [interneting is hard](www.internetingishard.com), and is just basic html and css stuff. Unfortunately, I lost all of my work from the first few chapters due to human error.
